# hello-world
Currently, I have no outstanding projects to put up on a github page so I am sticking with the option to keep the hello world 
tutorial up in the place of actual content. 

In the **future** I'd like to use this page to show off some of my more impressive higher level course projects or personal side projects.

Messing around with the markdown stuff here

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

Trying out markdown tables | Could be cool
